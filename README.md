How to Play

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in an empty cell.

The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.

If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

The game can be restarted at any time.
